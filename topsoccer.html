<div class="paragraph" style="color: #009688;">
  <p>I’m a volunteer Buddy in the TOPSoccer program at the Schaumburg Athletic Association (SAA). TOPSoccer provides children with disabilities the chance to be active and have fun with soccer themed activities led by a Buddy. I joined TOPSoccer because I believe in the value of playing sports and being on a team, so I wanted to provide those with disabilities this opportunity as well.</p>
  <p>I went into my first TOPSoccer session feeling very confident in my ability to interact with the athletes and make a positive difference in their lives. The session, however, did not go as planned. I had never interacted with a child with disabilities before, and although I was trying my best, I could not successfully engage my player, Jacob. Jacob began to lose interest in the standard TOPSoccer drills we were doing (Soccer Simon Says, an obstacle course, penalty shots) and eventually wandered off on his own. After I had frantically tracked Jacob down and brought him back to the field, I felt like a failure for not being able to realize my goal of helping children with disabilities.</p>
  <p>Later that week, I reflected on my first session and decided to take a more active approach in being a Buddy. I searched online for tips to enhance communication with children with disabilities. I learned that gestures and nonverbal actions are just as important as verbal instruction and that pictures, demonstrations, and other visual cues help children relate words with objects. I also contacted Mrs. Jakobi, the head of TOPSoccer at SAA, and asked her how I could improve as a Buddy. Her biggest tip was “thinking outside of the box” because no session will ever go as predicted.</p>
  <p>Armed with the knowledge I gained through my self-reflection, I cautiously went into my second TOPSoccer session with Jacob. As we started the session, Jacob once again lost interest in the generic TOPSoccer drills. He wanted to play something new.</p>
  <p>As the now-familiar sense of panic threatened to overwhelm me, I realized I had to quickly find a novel way to regain Jacob’s attention and keep him active to rescue this session. Suddenly, I saw some unused foam balls on the ground and remembered Mrs. Jakobi’s advice to think outside of the box. I gathered the balls and introduced Jacob to dodgeball.</p>
  <p>Although TOPSoccer revolves around soccer, its primary purpose is to provide an avenue for the athletes to be active and have fun. Dodgeball would perfectly achieve this purpose.</p>
  <p>Jacob didn’t know what dodgeball was, so I convinced him that it was the greatest game in the world by physically showing him how to throw and dodge the ball. By now, some other athletes and Buddies had gathered around, so I explained the rules to the group. Within minutes, a dozen athletes and Buddies were running, throwing, dodging, and having the time of their lives. We ended up playing for the rest of the session. I had achieved my goal of keeping Jacob active and was fulfilled knowing that I had given him and his fellow athletes an unforgettable experience.</p>
  <p>I’ve regularly volunteered at TOPSoccer for more than three years now. I’ve gained valuable leadership experiences and have seen the positive impact I’ve had on Jacob and dozens of other athletes every session, which is truly rewarding.</p>
