    I was introduced to computer science (CS) in my freshman year of high school in my AP CS Principles class. I immediately fell in love with the subject. I completed multiple projects: a personal website, a number base converter, a mad-lib generator.
    For the AP exam, I created a Soccer Statistic Calculator using Python that helps coaches make decisions using their players’ game data. I loved this project because it combined my interests in soccer, math, and CS, it had a practical use, and I got a 5 on the AP exam.
  </p>
  <p>
    After my positive experiences in AP CS Principles, and as I grew more confident in my programming skills, a new goal began to take shape in my mind: to build solutions that improve people’s well-being and quality of life.
    This was not just a vague goal for my post-college future - I wanted to work towards this goal immediately. I started by developing <a href="https://vegan-me.github.io/vegan-me/" target="_blank">VeganMe</a>, a website for vegans to adjust to the vegan lifestyle.
    I knew from personal experience that going vegan was difficult, so I wanted to create an application that helps people overcome the initial hardships many new vegans face. In 2019, I submitted “VeganMe” to the national Camp Khan programming challenge hosted by Khan Academy and won “Top Programming Project”.
    This recognition reinforced the belief that I could create solutions that could improve people’s lives, and had found my calling in CS.

    I've sought to further my goal of helping others through technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) by majoring in computer science and being involved in a variety of social endeavors on campus.
    In my first year, I joined <a href="https://www.illiniscno.org/" target="_blank">Illinois Students Consulting for Nonprofits (SCNO)</a>, a UIUC student organization that provides management and technology consulting services to nonprofits. In my first semester with SCNO, I was a consultant and helped improve 
    <a href="https://www.fotp.org/" target="_blank">Friends of the Parks'</a> website. I enjoyed this experience as it was my first experience with consulting, the role required me to combine my passions for business and technology, and 
    I was able to help a nonprofit whose mission resonated with me. In my second semester with SCNO, I was promoted to be the project manager for a project in which SCNO assisted the
    <a href="https://saltandlightcoalition.com/" target="_blank">Salt & Light Coalition</a> with migrating their data to Salesforce. I enjoyed this experience even more because I loved taking ownership of the project, communicating with the client, and leading my team of consultants.
    Now, I am the Client Relations partner at SCNO, and am responsible for bringing new clients on board to work with SCNO to continue to help nonprofits and provide real-world consulting experiences to UIUC students.

    I am also an undergraduate research assistant with the <a href="https://crowddynamicslab.github.io/" target="_blank">Crowd Dynamics Lab</a>, a UIUC CS research group headed by Professor Hari Sundaram. The Crowd Dynamics Lab is focused on using data analytics and machine learning to study how technology affects human behavior. 
    The lab is highly interdisciplinary, drawing from the computer science, psychology, and economics fields. My team's current research project is to determine whether online retailers show different prices to different users for the same product based on the users’ profiles.
    This project is attractive to me because it tackles price discrimination, and its ramifications could lead to a fairer online world.
