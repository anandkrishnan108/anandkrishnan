    In the summer of 2018, I attended the Minority Engineering Program at Purdue University for a week of discovery. One of the program’s challenges was to launch a bottle rocket that would safely eject a parachute with an egg inside. I had little previous hands-on engineering experience. However, when building the rocket with my team, I felt principles of physics such as force, pressure, and friction talking to me. What I had merely memorized in classrooms was coming to life, and I was captivated. When our rocket launched, it hung in the air for a second at the top of its parabolic motion. As it fell, the parachute deployed perfectly. We rushed towards the parachute as it landed, full of hope, but we were crushed to see the egg was broken. Conversely, our advisors didn’t let us lose heart. We went back to the drawing board, and after multiple tests, and fewer eggs in the cafeteria, we finally succeeded, and my STEM journey began.

    That fall, in my freshman year of high school, I was introduced to computer science (CS) in AP CS Principles. I immediately fell in love with the subject. I completed multiple projects: a personal website, a number base converter, a mad-lib generator. For the AP exam, I created a Soccer Statistic Calculator using Python3 that helps coaches make decisions using their players’ game data. I loved this project because it combined my interests in soccer, math, and CS, it had a practical use, and I got a 5 on the AP exam.

    After my positive experiences in AP CS Principles, and as I grew more confident in my programming skills, a new goal began to take shape in my mind: to build solutions that improve people’s well-being and quality of life. This was not just a vague goal for my post-college future -- I wanted to work towards this goal immediately. I started by developing <a href="https://vegan-me.github.io/vegan-me/">VeganMe</a>, a website for vegans to adjust to the vegan lifestyle. I knew from personal experience that going vegan was difficult, so I wanted to create an application that helps people overcome the initial hardships many new vegans face. In 2019, I submitted “VeganMe” to the national Camp Khan programming challenge hosted by Khan Academy and won “Top Programming Project”. This recognition reinforced the belief that I could create solutions that could improve people’s lives, and had found my calling in CS.
