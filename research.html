    Everything in the world is interconnected, from the human race; to the arts, sciences, and humanities; to sports; and a lot more. For example, can sixteenth century art exist without the science that keeps it fresh and alive today? Can scientific findings be adopted without examining them through an ethical lens? Have sports analysis shows on TV improved the quality of play on the field? I am motivated to understand the finer points of these interdisciplinary connections to make this world a better place.

    When I was a freshman in high school, I read Freakonomics by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner. Levitt is an award winning, but unconventional economist who uses an intense data-analysis approach to explore, put simply, why things in life are the way they are. Dubner is an acclaimed journalist who helped articulate Levitt’s ideas and acted as a bridge between the genius of Levitt and the reader. Throughout the entire book, I was fascinated by Dubner’s storytelling ability and Levitt’s studies: analyzing name data to determine whether certain names were more likely to bring success to the person, poring through Chicago Public Schools' standardized tests to catch cheating teachers, and the most interesting for me, understanding why crime in major American cities in the 1990’s dropped.

    From watching several crime movies and TV shows, to religiously reading every one of Sherlock Holmes’ exploits, to learning about Levitt’s controversial theory about the correlation between Roe v Wade and the crime drop in the 1990’s, I have always been fascinated by why people commit crimes. More specifically, I have always wondered why Chicago, one of the richest cities in the world and located a mere 40 miles away from me, has a massive crime problem. The city’s violence problems are well publicized in the media; however, there has been very little specific research conducted on the issue.
  </p>

    Inspired by the theme of Freakonomics, where the authors dug deeper into an issue of interest to understand what was happening and why, I explored my interest in Chicago crime in my AP Research class. My goal was to understand the relationship between gun homicides in the South Side of Chicago and firearm-purchase laws.

    First, I built my background knowledge by reading several articles, books, and research papers about gun crime in other countries, cities, and Chicago. I also read many legal journals discussing the merits of firearm-purchase laws, which define the process to legally purchase firearms. I would spend hours reading the differing viewpoints in these journals, fascinated by each of the dozens of perspectives in the gun control debate.

    One author’s name who I repeatedly came across during this initial stage of my research journey was Professor Emeritus Wesley Skogan at Northwestern University. I reached out to Professor Skogan and requested for him to be my mentor, since this was my first research experience. Professor Skogan accepted, and since then, he has been an incredible resource for me to gain advice and feedback to conduct my study, as well as a great person to talk to in general.

    After I had sufficiently built up my background knowledge, I chose an interval-analysis method where I recorded when each firearm-purchase law was passed and the gun homicide statistics at that time. I identified the firearm-purchase laws passed during the timeline of my study (1993-2018) by reading through every law in the Library of Congress database passed during this time period and determining if it was a firearm-purchase law. I collected raw crime data from the Chicago Police Department’s CLEAR Database and filtered the data using Google Sheets. After conducting the necessary statistical tests and analyzing gun homicide trends in each interval, I concluded that passages of firearm-purchase laws restricting the sale of guns were accompanied by decreases in gun homicides in the South Side of Chicago (<a href="https://emerginginvestigators.org/articles/firearm-purchase-laws-that-limit-the-number-of-guns-on-the-market-reduce-gun-homicides-in-the-south-side-of-chicago" target="_blank">link to research paper</a>). I received a 4 on the AP Exam and had my research published in the Journal of Emerging Investigators in January 2022.

    My research journey was a transformative experience not only for the hard skills I gained, like data collection and statistical analysis, but also for the soft skills I gained, like determination and curiosity of the unknown, that now spark my intellectual curiosity moving forwards. I would definitely like to continue the iterative process of discovery that is research in college.
