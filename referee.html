  <em>
    <p>It's freezing.</p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">I can barely see.</p>
    <p>I wonder what’s for dinner tonight.</p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">Hey – FOCUS!</p>
  </em>
  <br>
  <p>
    These thoughts scatter in my head as I squint through the deluge of rain to make out what is happening on the field around me. In the middle, a hard-fought game of soccer with elbows, kicks, and curses. On the sideline where I’m stationed, two irate coaches yelling at their teams. On the other sideline, a huddle of parents in ponchos, probably having thoughts like mine. There’s Larry, the center referee, controlling the game with his sharp whistle. Finally, there’s me – dressed in yellow, holding an orange flag, and sprinting along the sideline to keep up with the play. I’m a soccer referee, and this is my first game as an assistant referee (AR) in the highly competitive travel-soccer environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love soccer. Ever since I could kick a ball, I played in the local fields late into the night, pretending each match was as intense as the World Cup final. Some of my best memories were forged on the pitch. In order to view the game I loved from a different perspective, I decided to become a referee. I aced the certification exam and proudly received my badge from the US Soccer Federation. I contacted Larry Stone, a referee assignor and referee himself. Two weeks later, I was sprinting in the freezing rain…

  <p>I keep my eyes trained on the last defender to watch for a potential offside.</p>
  <p><em>Ignore the cold. Ignore the rain. Focus.</em></p>
  <p>Then I hear a voice hiss into my ear.</p>
  <p>“HEY! You missed that offside!”</p>
  <p>
    My concentration breaks. It’s one of the coaches, scornfully laughing at me. Suddenly, the other coach launches into a tirade against me. Apparently, I missed a foul on his team. I close my eyes and think, <em>Nothing can be worse than this.</em>
  </p>
  <p>When the game finally ends, I dejectedly trudge off the field. Then, Larry catches up with me and commends my performance. I think about the coaches who mocked me and realize their opinions are irrelevant. An esteemed referee like Larry did not have to compliment me, but he did anyway. My confidence in my refereeing ability is revived. Larry asks if I can referee a game tomorrow. I hesitate, then tell him to count me in.</p>

    Six months later, I am refereeing another game, as a center referee, looking to the ARs on the sidelines to confirm my calls in the middle. Suddenly, I spot an orange flag rising out of the corner of my eye. <em>Offside!</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    I blow my whistle, stopping the attacking team in their tracks. Groans erupt from the sidelines, and my AR receives an earful from the attacking team’s coach. I almost continue the game, but the tortured expression on my AR’s face stops me. I remember my own horrible experience with coaches on that cold, rainy night, and realize that I cannot allow my AR to suffer as I did.
  </p>
  <p>
    I approach the angry coach and explain to him that the correct decision was made, calmly telling him I will have to eject him the next time he disrespects my ARs. He immediately quiets. I blow my whistle to resume the game and catch an expression of gratitude from my AR. I smile to myself. <em>Larry would be proud</em>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I have now refereed over 300 games for college showcases, travel, and recreational tournaments. My motivation to referee is not only driven by my love for soccer, but also by my innate desire to seek intellectual challenge. Refereeing is about recognizing every part of the game - the players’ movement, the ball, and even the coaches (as I found out on that rainy night) - and requires great mental acuity. Each game in my career has presented a different challenge, and I have never failed to be intrigued by every game I have had the pleasure of refereeing.
