This is my personal website. It contains my mission statement describing why I want to study computer science, my computer science project portfolio, my research journey exploring the relationship between firearm-purchase laws and gun homicides in the South Side of Chicago, my love for soccer, and photos from my travels. My resume and contact information is also available on the site.

Please reach out to me via email at akrishx@gmail.com if you have any questions!
